            <p>My name is Brieanne Howard. I am a 25 year old  living in the Chicagoland area.<br> I have always
            found joy in problem solving and creating ?? for people to enjoy. Having a unique attention<br> to detail bla
            blah blah blah blah hoenstly right now this is all filler. I'm just creating the words here<br>
            so i canbetter style with csss oncw i figure out the format of my particular html.<br></p>
            <br>
            <p>honestly I dont think i have enough intrestin things about myself to put in here. I guess I can add <br>
            working for Lush or liking plants or anthropoloy as well. Maybe a dash of cooking as art appreciation?<br></p>
            <br>
            <p>Who knows, man. Stay tuned.</p>
