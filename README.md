Unit 01 HTML, CSS, and Git Homework.

This is my first homework assignment. It is a portfolio showcasing my newly developed skills. This assignment challenged me, it was my first true website I have ever built. I found the hardest thing was just getting started and sketching the layout and producing a clean code. Although I am not pleased with the final product I am happy for what it has taught me. I am able to see my strengths and areas of opportunity in the bootcamp now.
